\chapter{Artifact Reduction for VECAP Measurement}\label{chap:artifact}

\subparagraph{Abstract}
In the clinic, vestibular function is commonly evaluated through eye movement responses. These eye movement responses are also used for the assessment of vestibular implant performance. Additional  objective metrics, such as vestibular electrically evoked compound action potentials, may provide useful information. VECAPs have been reported before as a tool for electrode placement during surgery and were recorded with a modified cochlear implant. Here, we recorded VECAPs with a custom, double-sided electrode array in the ampulla of a guinea pig. Phase width had to be shortened to \SI{25}{\micro\second} compared to the typical phase width of \SI{200}{\micro\second}. The masker-probe technique reduced artifact and yielded VECAP comparable to literature. An artifact template was also created and could serve as a proxy for the full masker-probe paradigm.

\section{Introduction}
In Chapter\,\ref{chap:pamprm} we evaluated the effects of pulse amplitude and pulse rate modulation through the eye movement response. It is regarded as the most objective measurement of vestibular function. Perceptual or balance tasks could also be used for assessment. However, they additionally engage other sensory inputs such as vision or proprioception and therefore do not test vestibular function alone. In fact, some patients learn to compensate to some degree through other sensory inputs (Curthoys, 2000).

VECAPs may be an additional objective and exclusive metric of vestibular function. Generally in ECAP recordings, a measurement electrode is located extracellular, outside nerve fibers, and close to the source of electrical stimulation. Stimulation then induces synchronized action potentials in afferents and the measurement electrode records the sum of their voltage change (compound action potential). Recording of non-synchronized action potentials (i.\,e., spontaneous firing) would be on average not significantly different from zero. 

VECAPs would provide direct recording of the peripheral vestibular nerve before any central processing. Auditory ECAPs have been studied more extensively with cochlear implants, often with the objective to estimate implant performance or for fitting stimulation thresholds (e.g., Abbas et al., 1999; Bahmer et al., 2010). Auditory ECAPs have typically a duration of one millisecond and exhibit first a negative wave (N) and then a positive wave (P) (cf. Fig.\,\ref{fig:viconcept}D).

So far, VECAPs were reported as tool to improve electrode placement for a vestibular implant in rhesus monkeys (Nie et al., 2011). VECAPs had similar characteristics and waves compared to auditory ECAPs. In that study, obtaining peri-operative VECAPs was generally also predictive of post-operative eye movement responses to electrical stimulation. However, the group had difficulties to reproduce these results in human patients (Golub et al., 2013).

VECAPs could also be utilized for fitting of stimulation thresholds, similar to cochlear implants. We additionally believe that it could be used as feedback signal for a closed-loop VI that could potentially improve VI performance. Here, we present methods to acquire VECAPs with a custom, double-sided electrode array with eight active sites (Poppendieck et al., 2014). This design is markedly different from the electrode array of cochlear implants, that have electrode sites inside a silicone rubber tube. Yet techniques known from auditory ECAP recording were used with adjustments.

\section{Methods}
\subsection*{Animals and surgery}
One male, adult guinea pig was used for this study. The institutional animal care and use committee approved all experiments. In the first of three surgeries, the subject was instrumented with a fiberglass-composite structure (‘headbolt’) and a container for stimulation circuitry and connectors (‘headcap’). Second, a 3-turn stainless steel eye coil was inserted into the left eye for eye movement recording. Third, the double-sided electrode array with four sites each was implanted in the ampulla of the left horizontal canal. The electrode sites on the array were numbered as follows: 1-3-5-7 on the top side, 2-4-6-8 on the bottom side. The tip of the array had a width of \SI{245}{\micro\meter} and a length of approx. \SI{1.2}{\milli\metre}. A remote electrode was inserted into the neck muscle. The position of the array was checked during surgery with a portable stimulator and by monitoring eye movement. Details about the surgeries have been published elsewhere (Merfeld et al., 2006).


\subsection*{Stimulation and recording paradigm}
Stimulation and recording were applied with a MED-EL Research Interface Box II (RIB2, Innsbruck, Austria). Corresponding scripts were programmed in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The setup is illustrated in Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:setup}. 

The RIB2 provided voltage measurements with a resolution of \SI{5}{\micro\volt} at a sampling rate of 1.2 million samples per second (every \SI{0.83}{\micro\second}). Each recording had 2048 samples, approx. \SI{1.7}{\milli\second}. The samples were converted from analogue values to a digital sequence with an adaptive sigma-delta modulation (Zierhofer et al., 2000) and afterwards demodulated post-hoc with a Matlab script. Measurements were averaged over 25 iterations. 

To achieve VECAP recording several steps had to be performed, outlined below.

\subparagraph{Threshold identification}
Two weeks after the third surgery, thresholds were obtained for all eight electrode sites with the electrode in the animal's neck muscle serving as return electrode. Phase widths were \SI{200}{\micro\second} with a phase gap of \SI{2.1}{\micro\second} (minimum setting in RIB2). Pulse trains with 20 pulses at 250\,pps were applied and the animal was held by a second experimenter who monitored eye movement responses. Pulse amplitudes were increased in steps of \SI{10}{\micro\ampere} for each train. The lowest pulse amplitude that evoked an eye movement was set as vestibular threshold (THR). The pulse amplitude that first activated the facial nerve and resulted in facial twitching was set as most comfortable level (MCL).

Electrode site 4 was chosen for the remainder of the study with a lower threshold at \SI{60}{\micro\ampere} and no MCL. The results for all eight electrode sites are not reported herein for space. 

\subparagraph{Monopolar, bipolar stimulation and recording}
First, the aim was to record the nerve response to a single stimulation pulse, intentionally prior to any artifact reduction. Stimulation with electrode site 4 was monopolar or bipolar, i.\,e. the return electrode was the remote electrode in the neck or an electrode site on the array, respectively. Accordingly, recording was tested monopolar or bipolar. If both stimulation and recording were done bipolar, then the remote electrode was used by both.

The stimulation was applied with a single pulse, pulse amplitude was \SI{70}{\micro\ampere} and phase width \SI{200}{\micro\second}. At the time of the study, the hardware did not facilitate multipolar stimulation or recording and would have been beyond the scope of this pilot study.

Stimulation was applied through electrode site 4 and the recording through electrode site 3. The return electrode for monopolar configuration was the electrode located in the neck muscle. For bipolar configuration, electrode site 8 on the array was chosen arbitrarily as a first guess.

\subparagraph{Variation of phase width and measurement delay}
Second, the phase width was varied between 25 and \SI{200}{\micro\second} with stimulation and recording electrode sites determined from the previous step. \SI{200}{\micro\second} had been the typically used phase width in VI research. The measurement delay, i.\,e. the delay between beginning of stimulation pulse and measurement start, was also varied up to \SI{600}{\micro\second} from the RIB2 minimum (two times phase width plus phase gap and plus \SI{50}{\micro\second}). However, this compulsory blanking period to avoid amplifier saturation did not yield improvements. Therefore, recordings herein are reported for the minimum measurement delay.

\subparagraph{Combination of recording sites}
Third, all bipolar recording combinations were tested for monopolar stimulation of electrode site 4. For instance, recording was done with electrode site 1 and electrode site 8 as measurement return. This yielded 42 combinations in total. Specifically, recording with electrode site 1 to electrode site 8 was not considered as mirrored recording of electrode site 8 and electrode site 1 as return.

\subparagraph{Artifact reduction}
Fourth, having identified suitable electrode sites for stimulation and recording as well as phase width, artifact reduction techniques were applied. These stimulation artifacts arise due to the spatial proximity of electrode sites, thus resulting in a recording electrode site measuring partial stimulation \emph{signal} and not solely stimulation \emph{response}. 

In cochlear implants, the masker probe with three parts is a standard procedure (cf. Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:setup}). Three pulses are applied: (i) the probe pulse only, (ii) masker and probe pulses together with a distance of \SI{300}{\micro\second} and masker pulse amplitude \SI{10}{\micro\ampere} larger than the probe pulse amplitude, and (iii) the masker pulse only. The response to (i) contains the neural response to the probe pulse and the artifact to that pulse (response A). The response to (ii) contains the neural response to the masker pulse and artifacts of both the masker and probe pulses (response B), but not a neural response to the probe pulse. The masker pulse triggers an action potential in afferents first. These are then unable to respond again to the probe pulse since they are in an absolute refractory state (\SI{400}{\micro\second}). The response to (iii) contains the neural response to the masker pulse and the artifact of the masker pulse (response C). To obtain the neural response to the probe pulse, one has to subtract response B from response A and add response C.

We compared the masker-probe technique with two other techniques. The probe artifact template learned a probe artifact from recordings from a different day. The sub-threshold template learned an artifact template from recordings below averaging three lower threshold recordings and scaled it linearly with pulse amplitude (Nguyen et al., 2011).

\subparagraph{Amplitude growth function}
Finally, VECAPs were recorded with the aforementioned artifact reduction techniques for fourteen different pulse amplitudes.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Stimulation Settings}
Figure\,\ref{fig:artifact:monobipolar} shows the four combinations of monopolar and bipolar stimulation and recording. 

Monopolar stimulation above the threshold resulted in an eye movement response, bipolar stimulation (return with electrode site 8) did not yield eye movement responses, even at a the maximum pulse amplitude imposed by the stimulator (\SI{750}{\micro\ampere}). 

Monopolar recording had a small inflection around \SI{500}{\micro\second} and then returned to \SI{0}{\volt}. (Times are given from pulse onset.) However, monopolar stimulation and recording shared the same return electrode which may introduce difficulties in later studies.

Bipolar recording of monopolar stimulation experienced saturation that lasted until \SI{600}{\micro\second}. Bipolar recording of bipolar stimulation showed a rise to a constant level that indicated saturation of the amplifier.

\caption[Monopolar and bipolar stimulation and recording]{Monopolar and bipolar stimulation and recording. Plots show the measurement to a single pulse applied through electrode site 4. Bipolar stimulation did not yield a physiological eye movement response, and was not further pursued. With monopolar stimulation, monopolar recording had a short spike, while bipolar recording yielded amplifier saturation. Despite the saturation, monopolar stimulation and bipolar recording was the most encouraging configuration (red).}
\label{fig:artifact:monobipolar}
\end{figure}

For subsequent tests, monopolar stimulation and bipolar recording were chosen as they had the most promising measurement. To alleviate amplifier saturation, the phase width was decreased from the typically used \SI{200}{\micro\second} to \SI{25}{\micro\second}. Figure\,\ref{fig:artifact:phasewidth} illustrates the effect of the shorter phase widths. The saturation is first shortened and eventually does not affect the \SI{25}{\micro\second} measurement.

Continuing with \SI{25}{\micro\second}, all 42 bipolar recording combinations were tested for monopolar stimulation with electrode site 4. Specifically, measurements were taken with electrode site 1 and return with electrode site 8, or in short notation 1-8, continuing with 1-7, 1-6 etc.. The pair 8-5 was the combination that resembled VECAP and auditory ECAPs from literature. This pair was used afterwards for artifact reduction.

\label{fig:artifact:phasewidth}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Artifact Reduction Techniques}
Artifact reduction was performed with the standard masker-probe technique and compared to templates derived from data either from an earlier day (probe artifact template) or sub-threshold measurements. Figure\,\ref{fig:artifact:vecap}A-C shows the responses A, B, and C. Responses B and C had larger voltages than response A due to the added response components of the masker pulse. 

The probe artifact (subtracting response C from response B) or the probe artifact template were similar in shape in size. In contrast, the sub-threshold template had a different shape, already similar to an actual VECAP recording (Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:vecap}D-F).

Subtracting the artifact (template) from the response A yielded VECAP measurements for the three techniques. Both probe artifact and the probe artifact template showed a VECAP with a (sharp) negative wave and a positive wave. Instead, VECAP calculated with the sub-threshold template had only a postive peak (Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:vecap}G-I).

The amplitude growth function (AGF) reports the dependency of N-P voltage in VECAP for different probe pulse amplitudes (Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:vecap}J). For the probe artifact, AGF increased almost linearly up to \SI{600}{\micro\ampere} and then flattened. A similar AGF was measured for the probe artifact template (no measurements lager than \SI{600}{\micro\ampere}). The AGF of the sub-threshold template was lower than the other two and did not flatten, but kept increasing beyond \SI{600}{\micro\ampere}. Since the VECAP did not have a negative wave, the P value was used for the AGF.

\section{Discussion}
VECAP was successfully obtained with a custom, double-sided electrode array implanted in the semicircular canal of a guinea pig. Different stimulation configurations were tested and VECAP was recorded with artifact reduction techniques showing similarities with VECAPs and auditory ECAPs from the literature.

\subparagraph{Protocol for VECAP acquisition}
Monopolar stimulation resulted in clear eye movement responses that a second experimenter qualitatively observed while holding the animal. This was expected as on can assume a larger electrical field due to the distance of the return electrode in the neck muscle. In contrast, bipolar stimulation used two electrode sites on the electrode array and no eye movement response was observed, even for maximal pulse amplitudes. Although bipolar stimulation may offer more selective and specific stimulation through a smaller electric field, it was not pursued any further since no eye movement response could be observed.

Monopolar recording of monopolar stimulation shared the identical return electrode. Contrary to expectation, this did not lead to amplifier saturation. However, no clear response was seen in the measurement (Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:monobipolar}). Bipolar recording, on the other hand, led to amplifier saturation, but a negative wave was visible and therefore further pursued.

To reduce stimulation artifact, phase width was reduced. A short phase width of \SI{25}{\micro\second} was then chosen for further measurements. This phase width was considerably shorter than the phase width typically used in vestibular implants for animal models or patients (\SI{200}{\micro\second}). But it was more similar to phase widths used in cochlear implants (e.\,g., \SI{30}{\micro\second}). In fact, this could mean that the pulse rate may have to be increased for vestibular implants to achieve a comparable eye movement response to the response with \SI{200}{\micro\second} phase width. A collaborator tested \emph{chopped} pulses: eight pulses with a phase width of \SI{25}{\micro\second} at a pulse rate of 1500\,pps and compared the response to the response to a single pulse with \SI{200}{\micro\second} phase width. The eye movement response was marginally larger for the latter, but the shorter phase width would facilitate recording (D. Jiang, \textit{pers. comm.}, February 2013).

These first measurements contained stimulation artifact due to the proximity of stimulation and recording electrodes on the electrode array. The masker-probe technique was applied and yielded VECAP with negative and positive waves similar to ECAPs in the literature. VECAP recordings presented herein and literature are difficult to compare to literature due to the different electrode arrays and their surgical placement. Latencies in our VECAP recordings were shorter with the negative and positive waves occurring before \SI{200}{\micro\second} and at approx. \SI{230}{\micro\second}, respectively. In literature, negative waves peak between 200-\SI{300}{\micro\second} and positive waves between 400-\SI{600}{\micro\second} (Abbas et al., 1999; Nie et al., 2011). This could be due to species and size difference -- here guinea pig, literature rhesus monkey or human -- and also recording configuration -- here bipolar, literature monopolar. The smaller size of the vestibular labyrinth in the guinea pig could explain shorter traveling times for action potentials and thus shorter latencies.

However, from the 42 possible recording combinations, only a few combinations had N-P characteristic. A better understanding of how the VECAP signal is measured with the given electrode array is necessary. Lai and Dillier proposed a two component model for auditory ECAPs to explain different ECAP shapes. More recent models use finite element modeling and computational models of neurons to simulate the electrical stimulation by a vestibular implant (Hayden et al., 2011, Marianelli et al., 2015). These models could be modified to include VECAP recording.

The masker-probe technique, however, has one drawback. The application of a masker pulse would have an undesired physiological response such as eye movement. A probe artifact template and a sub-threshold template were tested as alternatives. The probe artifact template, learned with data from another day, was a good proxy for the full masker-probe technique. This was visible in the individual VECAP measurements and also in the amplitude growth function. The sub-threshold template, however, returned only a sharp positive wave. This indicated that measurements with 'sub-threshold' pulse amplitude already contained some compound action potential, although no eye movement response was observed. This was further emphasized by the shape of the sub-threshold template with the negative and positive waves (Fig.\,\ref{fig:artifact:vecap}F). For VECAP we would not recommend using sub-threshold artifact reduction.

\subparagraph{Comparison to other recording modalities}
Other electrophysiological tools exist to measure more directly in single afferents (peripherally or centrally) or to measure responses with longer latency such as vestibular evoked myogenic potentials.

Single unit recordings would provide the highest temporal and spatial resolution, but would require, for instance, needle or tungsten microelectrodes and their implantation for chronic measurements. Furthermore, these recordings would require more extensive analysis (e.\,g., spike sorting) than the minimum and maximum search for VECAP (with some time constraints).

Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials are used clinically to assess otolith function. They are evoked by short pulses of air-conducted sound, electrical stimulation or bone-conducted vibration and measured with surface electrodes placed on muscles (Rosengren et al., 2010). Since it is a myogenic response, latencies are in the range of 10-\SI{30}{\milli\second}. In comparison, VECAPs occur within one millisecond and, more conveniently, they can be recorded with the electrode array that is also used for stimulation. 

\section{Summary}
We successfully recorded VECAP with a custom, double-sided electrode array in one guinea pig. The masker-probe paradigm could be substituted with a probe artifact template to avoid physiological responses to the masker pulse. Furthermore, VECAPs may have a good utility, i.\,e. they may provide additional, useful information without the requirement for extra special acquisition hardware.
