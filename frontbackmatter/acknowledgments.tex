\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to work in Zurich, Lausanne, Geneva, Maastricht and Boston where I met so many great and inspiring people. I am thankful to all of them and I appreciated having met and worked with them.

I want to especially thank Jack DiGiovanna, PhD, Prof. Micera, and Prof. Morari for their support and supervision as well as helping me to grow as researcher. Thank you also, Dr. Seemungal, for being on my committee.
